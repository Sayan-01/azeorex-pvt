### How Subdomain Feature Works
- In production, my DNS should support wild card subdomains, Add  a DNS record like `*.azeorex.com` -> pointing to your Next.js server IP.
- Use middleware to detect subdomain.
- For a request to https://subdomain.azeorex.com/, the server internally rewrites the request to https://azeorex.com/subdomain, while the user sees https://subdomain.azeorex.com/.
